This repository contains the data used for the manuscript 'Using sea level to infer the strength of the Cape Horn Current'

The matlab scripts are used to analyse the raw data and generate the data for plotting which have been stored in the format of matlab data (in data branch).

The codes for plotting figures are stored in python scripts named by figxx.py and supxx.py. The fig01.py, fig02.py and fig03.py are used to plot figures 01-03 in the manuscript. The sup01.py - sup09.py contains the python codes to plot the figures (Figure S1-S9) in supplementry materials.
